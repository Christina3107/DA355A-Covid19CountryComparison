# Corona Country Comparison (Inlämningsuppgift 3 i kursen "Flerplattformsapplikationer med webbtekniker" vid MAU)
This website was created as the final project of the DA355A Multi-platform application course at Malmö University. The main purpose of this site is to visualize data retrieved from the Covid-19 API in a meaningful way. The user can select a country, then a comparison of Covid-19 cases per 100 000 inhabitants between the chosen country and the user's current location is visualized. A live version of the website can be accessed here: https://webshare.mah.se/ai8134/index.html
